Unity Simulation for flow arts

Current, only 4 moves programmed, and are toggled by (e, r, t, y), until I get a menu in.

The models for both hoops and poi are setup, and functional. 
you can switch betwween hoops and poi for all tricks setup. 
In theory, if you setup the spinner model correctly, the same code should work on all spinners and do all of the same tricks correctly.

The prop object and the should are setup for rotation. 
TODO: setup forearm for rotation around elbow.
